you have forget prefix of makemigrations command output file.

when you run command

python manage.py makemigrations polls
then you will see in output 0001_any_name.py

here 0001 is use in sqlmigrate command for create database that you forget to add in your command.

So write command

python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
It will works

if you run python manage.py sqlmigrate pools 0001 

it will then list the commands it did to change db

stop server then restart start.sh script and look at results in django admin screen
